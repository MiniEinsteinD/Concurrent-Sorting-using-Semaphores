Description of the important goals of my design:


    I used an integer [i] that keeps track of every child's process that is being executed. 
    I used a while loop to fork 3 children from the parent process.  
    The main goal of this design decision is to use a more efficient way to fork the children's processes instead of using many switch statements 
    which makes the code more complicated and less readable.  
    My code breaks out of the while loop when a child process is detected and enters a switch statement to execute the proper code for each process.

    Finally, I decided to include 3 wait statements in the parent process inside the switch statement so the parent waits until all the children are done altering the variables in the shared memory. 
    The parent starts using the variables from the shared memory that the children finished altering and comes up with the final results.

    The overall design goals are to keep the code easy, concise, understandable, and more efficient. 
    I went through multiple iterations to develop this final design and I hope it meets all the requirements to achieve an efficient and functional project.
