Some test results:

The input: 

	X, A, z, M, W, y, D

The final output: 

	The ordered array is: 
	x	a	d	m	w	y	z	
    

Discussion: 

    By comparing the resulting answer using the code I developed and the answer obtained from the calculator, 
    I did not achieve the exact same results which implies that my code does not function correctly.
