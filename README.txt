Concurrent Sorting using Semaphores


Descrption: 

The project developed can to sort a list of seven distinct letters. They should be sorted in lexicographic (alphabetic) order. The parent process forks 3 child processes. 
All 3 children processes run concurrently and contribute to the computation of sorting the array. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage & Input:

The code runs by simply executing the make file by entering the command "make" in the terminal and then running the generated executable code that is 
named "CSORT" by simply typing the following command "./CSORT". 
After running the code, a detailed and explanation will be printed in the command shell. 
First, the user is promoted to input 7 distinct chars. The user should enter each char and press enter after it.be printed followed by a message identifying every running process and the values executed within this process.  
Finally, the final sorted list will be printed in the parent process.

Output: 

Note: You will not obtain a correct results because I did not write a correct code but you will obain a partially sorted array.
